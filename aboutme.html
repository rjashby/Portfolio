    <h3>Background</h3>
    <img src="" alt="">
    <p>I was born in Indianapolis, Indiana, but I grew up in Central Pennsylvania (we just say PA), just outside <span id="PA">Harrisburg, PA.</span></p>
    <p>I am the first born of 4 boys in my clan, and family is very important to me.</p>

    <h3>School</h3>
    <p>I attended catholic schools from pre-school through 12th grade. I don't recommend it, but it taught me some valuable lessons and morals. I am thankful for both.</p>
    <p>I went to Penn State University for undergrad, having little to no clue what I wanted to do or study. I was simply thankful to be out of the house and on my own. In hindsight, I probably should have held off on school until I had a better grasp of what direction I wanted to take my life.</p>
    <p>After getting a couple degrees and taking a year off to travel, I decided to enroll in law school. Again, I didn't really have a plan, but school made sense to me. I graduated and passed the bar. I made my way out to California for a year to wander around, before coming back to PA to practice law.</p>

    <h3>Work</h3>
    <p>I initially took a job with the PA Dept of Labor, as a law clerk. About a year later, I met my new boss at an office Christmas party, and I practiced civil litigation in and around Philadelphia, PA, and the whole state really, for the next 4 years.</p>
    <p>I decided to move west to be closer to my brother who had moved to Portland. I spent a bit more time traveling before settling in and working at a series of law firms. I tried big, small, medium, in-house, solo, you name it.</p>
    <p>Eventually I hung it up after nearly 10 years as an attorney.</p>
    <p>I went to work as a mail carrier for the US Postal Service at the start of the pandemic. Once it looked like there might be a return to normal life (WRONG!), I decided to change career paths once more, in hopes of securing myself a better future.</p>
    <p>I enrolled as a coding student at Epicodus, and I'm more than excited about what's to come. I relish the opportunity to work and study hard to be an accomplished coder.</p>
